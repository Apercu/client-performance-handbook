# HTTP and the Constraints We Face

HTTP is a blessing and a curse: it's the protocol that makes the web possible. A client makes a request for a piece of content with a given identifier and a set of information describing the client, and a server responds with some metadata about the resource and the content of the resource. On paper, it sounds great. In practice, HTTP is na√Øve and inefficient, and does little to help out with improving performance.

Most of this inefficiency resides in the fact that HTTP was designed as a serial protocol. One request would be made, and a response would be returned. The client would make another request (or more), and more responses would be returned. When Tim Berners-Lee and his team first developed the protocol, it wasn't known that within two decades content on the "WorldWideWeb" would be as rich, diverse, and interactive as it is today.


## Minimizing Headers

When a web application makes many requests to a server for many files, most of the information being sent is redundant. The client's `User-Agent` header, connection information, cache data (if available), and other information is identical between requests. HTTP2 minimizes the impact of this by allowing header compression, but the first request (or response) is still impacted by large amounts of header data. If this crosses the TCP window size, it may take multiple packets just to allow the server to begin processing the request or sending the actual response content.

To alleviate this, take great care to minimize the number of custom headers sent back and forth between the client and the server.

Consider the following HTTP headers from Wikipedia, when retrieved using Google Chrome:

```raw
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Content-language: en
X-UA-Compatible: IE=Edge
Vary: Accept-Encoding,Cookie
Last-Modified: Sat, 10 May 2014 12:32:06 GMT
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
X-Varnish: 4067608437, 4126058259 4125899187, 2089471119 2040225699
Via: 1.1 varnish, 1.1 varnish, 1.1 varnish
Content-Length: 38922
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Date: Sun, 11 May 2014 00:35:30 GMT
Age: 43369
Connection: keep-alive
X-Cache: cp1067 miss (0), cp4009 hit (3), cp4008 frontend hit (126)
Cache-Control: private, s-maxage=0, max-age=0, must-revalidate
Set-Cookie: GeoIP=::::v6; Path=/; Domain=.wikipedia.org
```

All of this data is sent to the client on every request. Let's take a look at each individual header:

Server
: This header is entirely unnecessary.

X-Content-Type-Options
: This header is used in IE and Chrome as a security feature.

Content-language
: This could instead be specified in the HTML using a `lang="en"` attribute.

X-UA-Compatible
: Only Internet Explorer uses this header, and the value can be set in the HTML via a `<meta>` tag.

Vary
: This header is used for caching, though the example here is likely to prevent caching proxies from serving Gzipped content to clients that don't support it and to allow separate caches per user. Virtually all clients support Gzip, so that part is probably unnecessary.

Last-Modified
: This header is also used for caching.

Content-Encoding
: This header turns on Gzip. It is very beneficial.

Content-Type
: The content type is a normal header to send, though the encoding does not need to be sent as part of the header. It can instead be sent as part of a `<meta>` tag, or detected by the client (a process that is surprisingly accurate).

X-Varnish
: This is internal data that is not used by the client. It can be eliminated.

Via
: This header is largely unneeded, and is unnecessary in the absence of proxy servers.

Content-Length
: This header defines how much content was returned, and is not harmful.

Accept-Ranges
: This broadcasts the server's ability to return partial content. This is useful for video files, where the client may seek to a particular timestamp in the video.

Date
: This header is required by HTTP.

Age
: This header is only used by intermediate caching proxies. This header is probably not necessary in this situation since the `Cache-Control` header always requires browsers to check to see whether the content is fresh before using it.

Connection
: This header is no longer needed, as HTTP/1.1 connections are persistent by default.[^1]

X-Cache
: Like `X-Varnish`, this header is not used by the client.

Cache-Control
: This header controls how the client (and any intermediate caching proxies) deal with the content. Details on how to use `Cache-Control` will be provided in the next section.

Set-Cookie
: This header sets a cookie. In this circumstance, though, the client's cookie is already set to the value provided, meaning the header is redundant and can be eliminated.

If the unnecessary headers were removed (or moved into the body) where possible, the response would look like this:

```raw
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Vary: Accept-Encoding,Cookie
Last-Modified: Sat, 10 May 2014 12:32:06 GMT
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 38922
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Date: Sun, 11 May 2014 00:35:30 GMT
Cache-Control: private, s-maxage=0, max-age=0, must-revalidate
```

The result is less than half the size, and means the client can begin receiving actual page content sooner.

Regarding cookie data, this information should be minimized as much as possible. Cookie information is sent on every single request to the host that it is defined for, meaning that a bloated cookie can cause a very significant amount of overhead if the request (or response) headers get split into multiple TCP packets.

On the client side, if there is more than a few dozen bytes worth of information that needs to be persisted, use a JavaScript interface like `localStorage` to store the information. If the information needs to be passed to the server, send it as the body of a POST request.


## Unneeded Response Headers

The following headers are obsolete and should no longer be used:

- **Pragma**: This header was made obsolete by HTTP/1.1. Use `Cache-Control: no-cache` instead.
- **Connection: keep-alive**: HTTP/1.1 connections are persistent by default. The `Connection` header should only be used to send `Connection: close`, though it's unclear why that behavior would be desirable.
- **Status**: This header is redundant and should not be used.

The following headers provide information which is not used by the client and should be removed:

- **Server**: While this header can be used for statistical purposes by researchers, it is unused in virtually all other circumstances.
- **X-Cache**: Set by some caching proxies.
- **X-Backend-Server**: Used as debugging information for some load balancers.

The following headers can be placed within HTML instead:

- Content-Language
- Content-Type (charset information)
- X-UA-Compatible
