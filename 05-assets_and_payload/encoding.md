# Encoding

Choosing the appropriate image format can sometimes be tricky. The wrong format can cause exceptional performance problems with a website. For example, encoding a photograph as a PNG file could triple the file size of the image.

The flow chart below should make it easier to choose which format to use.

Note that the rules above are not hard and fast. Sometimes, it may be more efficient to encode an image as PNG instead of JPEG if the image is sufficiently small, or if the number of colors in the image is lower than 256. Experiment to see which format provides the best file size for your needs.
