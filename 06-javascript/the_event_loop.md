# The Event Loop

All browsers run on what is known as an event loop. The event loop is just that: a single loop that checks if there is any work to be done and if there is, it does it. Granted, there are parallel operations that take place (certain compositing operations and web workers, for instance) but in general, a surprisingly small amount of parallelism exists in your browser.

The event loop handles the execution of all JavaScript. When something in JavaScript needs to be done, the event loop notices the task and fires the appropriate code, waiting for it to complete. Since JavaScript is single-threaded, all other code will wait for it to finish, no matter what. Even `setTimeout` commands will wait until executing scripts have completed, regardless of how soon their timer is set for. This is the same reason that all browsers ask if you want to "stop unresponsive scripts" when a piece of code runs for a very long time without ever finishing. Perhaps it is stuck in an infinite loop or performing some sort of extremely intense processing; regardless, it is not finishing a run to completion and yielding control of the browser back to the event loop.

The process of the event loop triggering a JavaScript function and waiting for all subsequent processing within the JavaScript engine to complete is known as a "run to completion." Understanding how this works is very important to being able to understand the performance characteristics of an application.
