# JavaScript

The default language of the web is JavaScript. Making most interactive content involves writing some form of JavaScript. CSS3 changes this to some extent, but any truly engaging experiences require some degree of JavaScript development.

- How JavaScript code is loaded
- When JavaScript code is loaded
- How fast the JavaScript code executes

Each of these concepts are discussed in this chapter.
