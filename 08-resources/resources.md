# Resources

This final chapter is a collection of bits of knowledge that don't have any proper category. The tools, tickets, and terms that I've described over the course of the book are all outlined here, along with some other information that I hope you find useful.

Resources related to web performance (and web development in general) are exceptionally plentiful, and these lists are by no means complete. And, at the fast pace that the web moves, much of this chapter is likely to be out-of-date by the time you read it. I encourage you to read this section as a condensed snapshot of the tools and information that are available at the time of writing. It is not meant to be an exhaustive list.
