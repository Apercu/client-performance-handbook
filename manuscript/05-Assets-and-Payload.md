# Assets and Payload

> A man that carries nothing through life finds his grave the fastest

Oftentimes, the slowest part of loading any single page is the time spent downloading the page's content and assets. There are many rules that browsers follow--or in some cases, don't follow--that make it difficult to understand when, how, and why requests are made and what order they're made in. There are also many little-known techniques that can be used to decrease the amount of time it takes to load these assets, whether it be by fetching content in advance, or by providing hints that clients can use to improve performance.

There are also techniques that can be used to minimize the amount of content sent over the wire. The fewer packets that need to be sent, the less time it takes to complete any given request.


## HTTP

C> HTTP: You're Stuck With It
C> Welcome to the web!

HTTP is a blessing and a curse: it's the protocol that makes the web possible. A client makes a request for a piece of content with a given identifier and a set of information describing the client, and a server responds with some metadata about the resource and the content of the resource. On paper, it sounds great. In practice, HTTP is na√Øve and inefficient, and does little to help out with improving performance.

Most of this inefficiency resides in the fact that HTTP was designed as a serial protocol. One request would be made, and a response would be returned. The client would make another request (or more), and more responses would be returned. When Tim Berners-Lee and his team first developed the protocol, it wasn't known that within two decades content on the "WorldWideWeb" would be as rich, diverse, and interactive as it is today.


### Minimizing Headers

When a web application makes many requests to a server for many files, most of the information being sent is redundant. The client's `User-Agent` header, connection information, cache data (if available), and other information is identical between requests. SPDY minimizes the impact of this by allowing header compression, but the first request (or response) is still impacted by large amounts of header data. If this crosses the TCP window size, it may take multiple packets just to allow the server to begin processing the request or sending the actual response content.

To alleviate this, take great care to minimize the number of custom headers sent back and forth between the client and the server.

Consider the following HTTP headers from Wikipedia, when retrieved using Google Chrome:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Content-language: en
X-UA-Compatible: IE=Edge
Vary: Accept-Encoding,Cookie
Last-Modified: Sat, 10 May 2014 12:32:06 GMT
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
X-Varnish: 4067608437, 4126058259 4125899187, 2089471119 2040225699
Via: 1.1 varnish, 1.1 varnish, 1.1 varnish
Content-Length: 38922
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Date: Sun, 11 May 2014 00:35:30 GMT
Age: 43369
Connection: keep-alive
X-Cache: cp1067 miss (0), cp4009 hit (3), cp4008 frontend hit (126)
Cache-Control: private, s-maxage=0, max-age=0, must-revalidate
Set-Cookie: GeoIP=::::v6; Path=/; Domain=.wikipedia.org
```

All of this data is sent to the client on every request. Let's take a look at each individual header:

Server
: This header is entirely unnecessary. It simply contains the name of the back-end server software.

X-Content-Type-Options
: This header is only useful for sites hosting user-uploaded content, and is only used by Internet Explorer (and potentially Chrome, though this is unclear).

Content-language
: This could instead be specified in the HTML using a `lang="en"` attribute.

X-UA-Compatible
: Only Internet Explorer uses this header, and the value can be set in the HTML via a `<meta>` tag.

Vary
: This header is used for caching, though the configuration used here is curious at best.

Last-Modified
: This header is also used for caching.

Content-Encoding
: Setting this header tells the client that the content is Gzip-encoded. It is highly beneficial.

Content-Type
: The content type is a normal header to send, though the encoding does not need to be sent as part of the header. It can instead be sent as part of a `<meta>` tag, or detected by the client (a process that is surprisingly accurate).

X-Varnish
: The data here is internal only and is not used by the client. This could be sent conditionally, or removed entirely.

Via
: This header is largely obsolete, and in this instance, entirely unnecessary.

Content-Length
: The length is a very common and benign header. Including it is not a problem.

Accept-Ranges
: This broadcasts the server's ability to return partial content. This is useful for video files, where the client may seek to a particular timestamp in the video.

Date
: This header is required by HTTP.

Age
: This header is only used by intermediate caching proxies. This header is probably not necessary in this situation since the `Cache-Control` header always requires browsers to check to see whether the content is fresh before using it.

Connection
: This header is no longer needed, as HTTP/1.1 connections are persistent by default.[^http11_persistent]

X-Cache
: Like `X-Varnish`, this header is not used by the client.

Cache-Control
: This header controls how the client (and any intermediate caching proxies) deal with the content. Details on how to use `Cache-Control` will be provided in the next section.

Set-Cookie
: This header sets a cookie. In this circumstance, though, the client's cookie is already set to the value provided, meaning the header is redundant and can be eliminated.

[^http11_persistent]: http://dxr.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/source/netwerk/protocol/http/nsHttpConnection.cpp#830

If the unnecessary headers were removed (or moved into the body) where possible, the response would look like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
Vary: Accept-Encoding,Cookie
Last-Modified: Sat, 10 May 2014 12:32:06 GMT
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 38922
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Date: Sun, 11 May 2014 00:35:30 GMT
Cache-Control: private, s-maxage=0, max-age=0, must-revalidate
```

The result is less than half the size, and means the client can begin receiving actual page content sooner.
