# Recommendations

The previous chapters have given a great deal of information on individual concepts. This provides a great starting point for understanding web performance on the whole, though putting the individual nuggets of information into practice can be tricky. This chapter is a distillation of that information into a set of easy-to-follow action items that you can use in your own work.

Be aware that these recommendations are generally one-size-fits-all, but certain applications may have unusual requirements that make them impractical to implement. Being unable to implement any of these does not preclude you from improving the performance of your application. Consider this chapter a guide to common pieces of low-hanging fruit; there are still many individual lessons and thoughts from the previous chapters that can easily be put into practice.
