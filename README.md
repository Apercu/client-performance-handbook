Performance is one of the most wide-reaching yet difficult-to-address topics in
web development. Because there are so many aspects to the discipline, it's
nearly impossible to consider each one in a serial way. In addition,
performance myths and misinformation often lead well-intentioned engineers to
make poor choices.

The Client-Side Performance Almanac is a guide to help web developers deliver
better quality products to their clients and employers.
