Performance is one of the most wide-reaching yet difficult-to-address topics in web development. Because there are so many aspects to the discipline, it's nearly impossible to consider each one in a serial way. In addition, performance myths and misinformation often lead well-intentioned engineers to make poor choices.

The Client-Side Performance Handbook is a guide to help web developers deliver better quality products to their clients and employers.
